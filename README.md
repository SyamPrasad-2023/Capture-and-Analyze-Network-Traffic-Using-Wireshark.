# Capture-and-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark.# Wireshark Packet Analysis Lab

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository documents a hands-on lab using **Wireshark** to capture, filter, and analyze network packets.  
The goal is to develop **packet analysis skills** and gain awareness of common network protocols.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Capture live network traffic
- Apply protocol filters (HTTP, DNS, TCP, ICMP, etc.)
- Identify at least 3 protocols in a capture
- Export capture files as `.pcap`
- Summarize findings with packet details
- Document analysis using screenshots
